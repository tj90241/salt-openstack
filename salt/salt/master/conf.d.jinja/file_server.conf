#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states
#
file_roots: {{ salt_defaults['master']['file_roots'] | yaml }}

# When using multiple environments, each with their own top file, the
# default behaviour is an unordered merge. To prevent top files from
# being merged together and instead to only use the top file from the
# requested environment, set this value to 'same'.
top_file_merging_strategy: {{ salt_defaults['master']['top_file_merging_strategy'] }}

# To specify the order in which environments are merged, set the ordering
# in the env_order option. Given a conflict, the last matching value will
# win.
env_order: {{ salt_defaults['master']['env_order'] | yaml }}
