# Disable multiprocessing support, by default when a minion receives a
# publication a new process is spawned and the command is executed therein.
#
# WARNING: Disabling multiprocessing may result in substantial slowdowns
# when processing large pillars. See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/38758
# for a full explanation.
#multiprocessing: True

# Limit the maximum amount of processes or threads created by salt-minion.
# This is useful to avoid resource exhaustion in case the minion receives more
# publications than it is able to handle, as it limits the number of spawned
# processes or threads. -1 is the default and disables the limit.
