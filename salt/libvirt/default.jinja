# Customizations for the libvirtd.service systemd unit

LIBVIRTD_ARGS=""

# The default upstream behavior is for libvirtd.service to
# start on boot, perform VM autostart and shutdown again if
# nothing was started; later on, systemd socket activation
# is used to start it again when some client app connects.
#
# The following can be used to enable this behavior
#LIBVIRTD_ARGS="--timeout 120"

# If systemd socket activation is disabled, then the following
# can be used to listen on TCP/TLS sockets
#LIBVIRTD_ARGS="--listen"

# Override the QEMU/SDL default audio driver probing when
# starting virtual machines using SDL graphics
#
# NB these have no effect for VMs using VNC, unless vnc_allow_host_audio
# is enabled in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
#QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=sdl
#
#SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse

### The following settings are IGNORED when using systemd ###

# This option can be used to prevent libvirtd from starting at boot
# even when the corresponding sysv service is enabled; a much better
# solution is to disable the service instead
#start_libvirtd=no

# Whether to mount a systemd like cgroup layout
#mount_cgroups=yes

# Which cgroups to mount
